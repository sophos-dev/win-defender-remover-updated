Updated Windows Defender Remover.  Just run the exectuable as administrator, and then wait for the pop up window saying its complete and to reboot your computer.  Updated to work on all windows versions 10 and 11.

If it does not work for you, remember, RUN IT AS ADMIN! 
If you want more verbose output, you can run this from cmd/powershell.
After running defender remover, give it a few minutes then you will see a pop up notifying you that it has completed and to reboot your system, simple as that! Currently working and tested on ALL Windows 10/11 Versions!!
